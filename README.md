Data necessary for running these codes can be found at: https://osf.io/kws9b/ 

/analysis_decoding
- Code for decoding orientations within the WM task and the perceptual control task, and code for cross-task decoding.
- This analysis depends heavily on Princeton MVPA toolbox, which you would need to download and add to path (http://www.csbmb.princeton.edu/mvpa).
  
/analysis_spaceRecon
- Code for performing spatial reconstruction for the WM task and the perceptual control task.


/models
- Code for model simulations for two modulated stimuli and line-like images.
- Model simulation depends heavily on codes publicy available by Roth et al (2018) at https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/stimulusVignetting.
